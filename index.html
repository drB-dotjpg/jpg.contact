        <div class="block">
            I've been playing Splatoon since the first game launched and instantly fell in love. After the launch of Splatoon 2 in 2018, I decided to explore the scene more. I formed a team named Assault and Pepper, officially entering the competitive Splatoon scene as a player.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            I stopped playing with Assault and Pepper in 2020 to pursue tournament organizing around the launch of a new tournament and production organization named Inkling Performance Labs. It was built off the success of a tourney named Low Ink, one of my favorite events to play, and I started staffing in after winning in July 2019. I got promoted from staff to head TO a couple of months after.
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            As Inkling Performance Labs grows, our production ambitions grow too. We're running both more major and more frequent tournaments. We're also starting to enter the realm of helping in-person events. I'm doing my part by helping with some of the production work the organization needs alongside the tourney organizing I typically handle. Most of the work I put into this scene is with Inkling Performance Labs, check us out at <nobr><a class="button" href="https://iplabs.ink/"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> iplabs.ink</a></nobr>

            <div class="block"><i>(Begun staffing 2019-Present)</i></div>
            <div class="block">Low Ink is a two day Splatoon 3 tournament for newer and lower level players. Our goal is to give teams a chance to get into the Splatoon 3 tournament scene and gain valuable competitive experience. This is achieved by barring higher-level teams from playing in this event. Each team is checked over manually to ensure they are at a suitable skill to play. Low Ink has had multiple events with more than 100 teams and is considered one of the biggest tournaments in the scene.</div>
            <div class="block">I am a head tournament organizer of Low Ink alongside two good friends. This means I typically oversee the event both on the days of the event and the days leading up to it.</div>
            <div class="block">Learn more about Low Ink at it's website (which I've created!) <nobr><a class="button" href="https://lowink.iplabs.ink/"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> lowink.iplabs.ink</a></nobr></div>
