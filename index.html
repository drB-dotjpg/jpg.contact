                    My name is .jpg, and I create esport designs and productions for numerous organizations. I’ve been
                    working in esports as a hobby for more than five years. I’ve organized major tournaments in the
                    past, but nowadays I focus most of my time on creating awesome looking productions through design
                    and code. I also create tools to help streamline processes in an esports production. I mainly reside
                    in the competitive Splatoon and Smash scene, but I have experience producing for other games such as
                    Valorant, Overwatch, and Rainbow Six Siege.

                    The Eggdog Invitational was a four-day event featuring 16 of the best Super Smash Bros. Melee
                    players in the world hosted August 29th to September 1st, 2024 in Richmond, BC, Canada.

                    Similar to last year's event, I was tasked to do the graphics integration for a major esports
                    live
                    stream. What this consists of is the creation of web pages that are overlayed on top of the live
                    stream. Using typescript for logic and scss for styling, I created detailed and animated web
                    pages
                    that match the specs provided by the design team.

                    This project helped me personally grow by using web components to reuse logic. We used Lit to
                    create
                    these web components, which is like a lightweight version of vue or react. I'm using this
                    project as
                    a
                    stepping stone to get better at these more popular, but more complex, frameworks!

                    In February 2024, I assisted my colleagues at Level 1 TV by integrating graphics for Full Bloom

                <div>
                    This was a fun one, and a personal milestone. While Level1 was all hands on deck creating the
                    production for Genesis X, one of the all time largest Smash tournaments, I was trusted to get
                    the
                    production for Full Bloom 2024 out the door. I'm happy they trusted me with this job.

                    I was hired by Level1 to create livestream graphics for the Canadian Smash Major, Battle of BC
                    5. I
                    was given concepts on what the graphics should look like. My role was to take these concepts,
                    and
                    turn them into an actual overlay that will work in OBS. These graphics had to respond to
                    dashboard
                    inputs and update accordingly to the data provided. In total, I had to create about 13 different
                    scenes.

                <div>
                    This project meant a lot to me. I got into esports through smash, so it was amazing to finally
                    work
                    on a major smash production. I hope to do more in the future.

                    Proving Grounds, the sequel to a past IPL tournament named Testing Grounds, is a bi-weekly
                    Splatoon
                    tournament taking place on Friday nights. It includes a small map pool and a format catered to
                    top
                    level play. My job was to handle all the production needs for this event. I've created nearly
                    all
                    the graphics (not the logo) seen in advertising as well as the stream overlay. The main
                    challenge
                    was how fast we wanted to get PG out the door, since demand for tournaments was at an all time
                    high.
                    I only had a couple days to get the production ready.

                    teams of varying skill levels. SOS has been running since the creation of IPL, and it was due
                    for a
                    redesign. This was the project that taught me a lot of the production skills I have today. I've
                    created all the graphics (not the logo) you see on social media and the stream overlay.

                    Creating Splatoon tournament map lists is a headache, and I strongly dislike doing it by hand. I
                    knew I wasn't the only one with this opinion. After numerous past projects trying to create an
                    automated map generator, I've finally perfected the algorithm to create nearly perfect map
                    lists,
                    ending error-prone hand-made map lists in IPL. <a href="https://maps.iplabs.ink">maps.iplabs.ink</a>

                    twitter. My solution was to create a discord bot that could take a Twitch clip and convert it
                    into a
                    downloadable video file with our branding added to it. With the help of this tool, any
                    tournament
                    organizer in IPL can take a moment from our livestream and put it on social media in about 1

                    Low Ink is a two day Splatoon 3 tournament for newer and lower level players. Our goal is to
                    give teams a chance to get into the Splatoon 3 tournament scene and gain valuable competitive
                    experience. This is achieved by barring higher-level teams from playing in this event. Each team
                    is checked over manually to ensure they are at a suitable skill to play. Low Ink has had
                    multiple events with more than 100 teams and is considered one of the biggest tournaments in the
                    scene.

                    Just
                    like all my previous streaming projects, all the overlays are created by making a web page that

                    layered over the stream. This web page serves as the graphics and features responsive

                    The webpage connects to a dashboard software that hosts a webserver in order to control the data

                    To improve branding across all GE player’s livestreams, I’ve created a very easy to use, browser
                    based source to add your name and social media to your livestream. The package comes with a
                    “card
                    scene” which can be overlaid on your gameplay, and a break scene for when you’re on break.

                    Every year I try to attend Riptide, a major Smash and Splatoon tournament in Ohio. My motive to
                    attend is to see my friends, but I also volunteer to help Splatoon's TOs and provide extra hands
                    for
                    the livestream. I've also been selected to MC for Splatoon in 2023.
