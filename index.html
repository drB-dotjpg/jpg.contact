                    My name is .jpg, and I create esport designs and productions for numerous organizations. I’ve been working in esports as a hobby for over 4 years. I’ve organized major tournaments in the past, but nowadays I focus most of my time on creating awesome looking productions through design and code. I also create tools to help streamline processes in an esports production.  While I mainly reside in the competitive Splatoon community, I’m branching out and creating productions for more games such as Super Smash Bros, Overwatch, Valorant, and much more! The organizations I specifically work with are Inkling Performance Labs, Level1, and the Gaming and Esports Club at ISU.

                Inkling Performance Labs is a competitive Splatoon tournament and production organization. Its goal is to unite and grow the community by creating high quality Splatoon tournaments. We want to promote the growth of Splatoon, both in working to bring in new members, along with helping improve those already in the community. I’ve been with IPL since it’s inception for both tournament organizing, design, and production.

                    Proving Grounds, the sequel to a past IPL tournament named Testing Grounds, is a bi-weekly Splatoon tournament taking place on Friday nights. It includes a small map pool and a format catered to top level play. My job was to handle all the production needs for this event. I've created nearly all the graphics (not the logo) seen in advertising as well as the stream overlay. The main challenge was how fast we wanted to get PG out the door, since demand for tournaments was at an all time high. I only had a couple days to get the production ready.

                    Swim or Sink is a weekly tournament series aimed at providing players with practice against other teams of varying skill levels. SOS has been running since the creation of IPL, and it was due for a redesign. This was the project that taught me a lot of the production skills I have today. I've created all the graphics (not the logo) you see on social media and the stream overlay.

                    Creating Splatoon tournament map lists is a headache, and I strongly dislike doing it by hand. I knew I wasn't the only one with this opinion. After numerous past projects trying to create an automated map generator, I've finally perfected the algorithm to create nearly perfect map lists, ending error-prone hand-made map lists in IPL. <a href="https://maps.iplabs.ink">maps.iplabs.ink</a>

                    To boost social media engagement, I want to create a way to quickly put tournament clips on the IPL twitter. My solution was to create a discord bot that could take a Twitch clip and convert it into a downloadable video file with our branding added to it. With the help of this tool, any tournament organizer in IPL can take a moment from our livestream and put it on social media in about 1 minute.

                    In January 2023, I added the ability to create graphics instantly using a collection of simple commands. Thanks to this, no software or previous graphic design experience is needed to create graphics for IPL events.

                    Low Ink is a two day Splatoon 3 tournament for newer and lower level players. Our goal is to give teams a chance to get into the Splatoon 3 tournament scene and gain valuable competitive experience. This is achieved by barring higher-level teams from playing in this event. Each team is checked over manually to ensure they are at a suitable skill to play. Low Ink has had multiple events with more than 100 teams and is considered one of the biggest tournaments in the scene.
