                    My name is .jpg, and I create esport designs and productions for numerous organizations. I’ve been working in esports as a hobby for more than four years. I’ve organized major tournaments in the past, but
                    nowadays I focus most of my time on creating awesome looking productions through design and code. I
                    also create tools to help streamline processes in an esports production. While I mainly reside in
                    the competitive Splatoon community, I’m branching out and creating productions for more games such
                    as Super Smash Bros, Overwatch, Valorant, and much more! The organizations I specifically work with
                    are Inkling Performance Labs, Level1, and the Gaming and Esports Club at ISU.

                    Inkling Performance Labs is a competitive Splatoon tournament and production organization. Its goal is
                    to unite and grow the community by creating high quality Splatoon tournaments. We want to promote the
                    growth of Splatoon, both in working to bring in new members, along with helping improve those already in
                    the community. I’ve been with IPL since it’s inception for tournament organizing, design, and
                    production.

                    tournament taking place on Friday nights. It includes a small map pool and a format catered to top
                    level play. My job was to handle all the production needs for this event. I've created nearly all
                    the graphics (not the logo) seen in advertising as well as the stream overlay. The main challenge
                    was how fast we wanted to get PG out the door, since demand for tournaments was at an all time high.
                    I only had a couple days to get the production ready.

                    redesign. This was the project that taught me a lot of the production skills I have today. I've
                    created all the graphics (not the logo) you see on social media and the stream overlay.

                    Creating Splatoon tournament map lists is a headache, and I strongly dislike doing it by hand. I
                    knew I wasn't the only one with this opinion. After numerous past projects trying to create an
                    automated map generator, I've finally perfected the algorithm to create nearly perfect map lists,
                    ending error-prone hand-made map lists in IPL. <a href="https://maps.iplabs.ink">maps.iplabs.ink</a>

                    To boost social media engagement, I want to create a way to quickly put tournament clips on the IPL
                    twitter. My solution was to create a discord bot that could take a Twitch clip and convert it into a
                    downloadable video file with our branding added to it. With the help of this tool, any tournament
                    organizer in IPL can take a moment from our livestream and put it on social media in about 1 minute.

                    In January 2023, I added the ability to create graphics instantly using a collection of simple

                    graphics for IPL events.

                    Low Ink is a two day Splatoon 3 tournament for newer and lower level players. Our goal is to
                    give teams a chance to get into the Splatoon 3 tournament scene and gain valuable competitive
                    experience. This is achieved by barring higher-level teams from playing in this event. Each team
                    is checked over manually to ensure they are at a suitable skill to play. Low Ink has had
                    multiple events with more than 100 teams and is considered one of the biggest tournaments in the
                    scene.

                    I was hired by Level1 to create livestream graphics for the Canadian Smash Major, Battle of BC 5. I was given concepts on what the graphics should look like. My role was to take these concepts, and turn them into an actual overlay that will work in OBS. These graphics had to respond to dashboard inputs and update accordingly to the data provided. In total, I had to create about 13 different scenes.

                    Every year around Halloween, GE will run a charity stream with a variety of games. Members of the club are welcome to join the event, hosted in the ISU gaming and esports room. People are encouraged to donate through fun incentives!

                    For 2023, we ran a 2 day stream with half the stream online and the other half in the ISU gaming and esports room. Alongside the graphics all coded by me, I was in charge of handing tech for getting donations on stream and getting people's computer feed to the stream using an RTMP server. We raised $5,445.69 for Games For Love.

                    Tempest is a weekly smash tournament hosted by the Gaming and Esports Club at ISU and Ames Smash. I've created the livestream overlays and graphics for this event, which is implimented in the GE livestream overlay hub for all the club's streamers to access.

                    To improve branding across all GE player’s livestreams, I’ve created a very easy to use, browser based source to add your name and social media to your livestream. The package comes with a “card scene” which can be overlaid on your gameplay, and a break scene for when you’re on break.
