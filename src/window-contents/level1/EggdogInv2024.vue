        <h2>August 2024 - September 2024</h2>
        <p>My role: Creation of livestream graphic sources from preexisting concepts. Connected those graphics to
            respond to
            inputs from a dashboard.</p>
        <p>The Eggdog Invitational was a four-day event featuring 16 of the best Super Smash Bros. Melee players in the
            world hosted August 29th to September 1st, 2024 in Richmond, BC, Canada.</p>
        <p>I was hired to impliment the graphics for this event. It was nothing I couldn't handle, but the real
            challenge
            was the tight deadline. This event had a crazy turnaround time.</p>
