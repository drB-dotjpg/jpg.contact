        <h1>LACS Rivals</h1>
        <h2>October 2024 - November 2024</h2>
        <p>My role: Work with offbrand's design team to create livestream concepts. Turn concepts into a stream graphics package. Act as on-site CG operator.</p>
        <p>LACS Rivals is an invitational Smash Melee/Ult and Rivals 2 event hosted in LA. About 29 players were invited to play. The event took place on November 23-24</p>
        <p>I was brought on as graphics integration and CG. As far as graphics packages go, this was the biggest I've ever done. I was also, somewhat last minute, flown in to work on site. This was my first time getting flown to an event to staff it. I acted as on-site graphics support and the main CG operator. Being able to work with offbrand and the crew I was with was an absolute honor and I look forward to where these connections take me in the future.</p>
