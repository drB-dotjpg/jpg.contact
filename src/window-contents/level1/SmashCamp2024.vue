        <p>My role: Creation of livestream graphic sources from preexisting concepts. Connected those graphics to
            respond to inputs from a dashboard, which was created by another team.</p>
        <p>Smash Camp is the coolest event in the world. It's a weekend long smash event that takes place in a camp.
            Each player gets to stay in cabins on site.</p>
