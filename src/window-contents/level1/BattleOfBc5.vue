        <h2>May 2023</h2>
        <p>I was hired by Level1 to create livestream graphics for the Canadian Smash Major, Battle of BC 5. I was given
            concepts on what the graphics should look like. My role was to take these concepts, and turn them into an
            actual overlay that will work in OBS. These graphics had to respond to dashboard inputs and update
            accordingly to the data provided. In total, I had to create about 13 different scenes.</p>
        <p>This project meant a lot to me. I got into esports through smash, so it was amazing to finally work on a
            major smash production. I hope to do more in the future.</p>
