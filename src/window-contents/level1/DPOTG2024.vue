        <p>My role: Creation of livestream package + livestream graphics.</p>
        <p>DPOTG 2024 is a Smash Major taking place in Seattle, WA and hosted by Level1, Galint Gaming, and WGA. It took place on November 16-17.</p>
        <p>I was behind most of the graphics package for this event. I pulled some designs from the Smash Camp stream and modified them with DPG's design language. This was Level1's first event to properly show off some new features I've worked on, such as the results graphic, bracket graphic, and an improved quad graphics system.</p>
