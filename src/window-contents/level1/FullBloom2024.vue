        <h2>February 2024</h2>
        <p>My role: Creation of livestream graphic sources from preexisting concepts. Connected those
            graphics to respond to inputs from a dashboard, which was created by another team.</p>
        <p>In February 2024, I assisted my colleagues at Level 1 TV by integrating graphics for Full Bloom
            2024.</p>
        <p>This was a fun one, and a personal milestone. While Level1 was all hands on deck creating the
            production for Genesis X, one of the all time largest Smash tournaments, I was trusted to get the
            production for Full Bloom 2024 out the door. I'm happy they trusted me with this job.</p>
        <p>During this time, I was also pulled in to help with emergency graphics integration for Genesis
            X.</p>
