        <p>My role: Redesign tournament & Create new livestream overlays</p>
        <p>Swim or Sink is a weekly tournament series aimed at providing players with practice against other teams of
            varying skill levels. SOS has been running since the creation of IPL, and it was due for a redesign. This
            was the project that taught me a lot of the production skills I have today. I've created all the graphics
            (not the logo) you see on social media and the stream overlay.</p>
