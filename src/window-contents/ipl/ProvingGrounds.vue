        <p>My role: Design & Livestream Overlay</p>
        <p>Proving Grounds, the sequel to a past IPL tournament named Testing Grounds, is a bi-weekly Splatoon
            tournament taking place on Friday nights. It includes a small map pool and a format catered to top level
            play. My job was to handle all the production needs for this event. I've created nearly all the graphics
            (not the logo) seen in advertising as well as the stream overlay. The main challenge was how fast we wanted
            to get PG out the door, since demand for tournaments was at an all time high. I only had a couple days to
            get the production ready.</p>
