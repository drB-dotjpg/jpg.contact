        <p>Low Ink is a two day Splatoon 3 tournament for newer and lower level players. Our goal is to
            give teams a chance to get into the Splatoon 3 tournament scene and gain valuable competitive
            experience. This is achieved by barring higher-level teams from playing in this event. Each team
            is checked over manually to ensure they are at a suitable skill to play. Low Ink has had
            multiple events with more than 100 teams and is considered one of the biggest tournaments in the
            scene.
