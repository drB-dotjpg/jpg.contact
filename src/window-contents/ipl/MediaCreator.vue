        <p>My role: Creation of bot and its assets.</p>
        <p>To boost social media engagement, I want to create a way to quickly put tournament clips on the IPL twitter.
            My solution was to create a discord bot that could take a Twitch clip and convert it into a downloadable
            video file with our branding added to it. With the help of this tool, any tournament organizer in IPL can
            take a moment from our livestream and put it on social media in about 1 minute.
        </p>
        <p>In January 2023, I added the ability to create graphics instantly using a collection of simple
            commands. Thanks to this, no software or previous graphic design experience is needed to create
            graphics for IPL events.</p>
