        <h1>Charity Stream 2023</h1>
        <h2>Started work June 2023 - Streamed in October 2023</h2>
        <p>My role: Create livestream overlays and graphics. Run the livestream and its related tech.</p>
        <p>Every year around Halloween, GE will run a charity stream with a variety of games. Members of the club are
            welcome to join the event, hosted in the ISU gaming and esports room. People are encouraged to donate
            through fun incentives!</p>
        <p>For 2023, we ran a 2 day stream with half the stream online and the other half in the ISU gaming and esports
            room. Alongside the graphics all coded by me, I was in charge of handing tech for getting donations on
            stream and getting people's computer feed to the stream using an RTMP server. We raised $5,445.69 for Games
            For Love.</p>
