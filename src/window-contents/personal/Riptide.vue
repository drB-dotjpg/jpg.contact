        <h2>September 2021 - Present</h2>
        <p>Every year I try to attend Riptide, a major Smash and Splatoon tournament in Ohio. My motive to
            attend is to see my friends, but I also volunteer to help Splatoon's TOs and provide extra hands for
            the livestream. I've also been selected to MC for Splatoon in 2023.</p>
